## +T what's Next for Security Testing

### Establish Conitinuous Application Security Testing

Building code securely is important. But it’s critical to verify that the security you intended to build is actually present, correctly implemented, and used everywhere it was supposed to be. The goal of application security testing is to provide this evidence. The work is difficult and complex, and modern high-speed development processes like Agile and DevOps have put extreme pressure on traditional approaches and tools. So we strongly encourage you to put some thought into how you are going to focus on what’s important across your entire application portfolio, and do it cost-effectively.

Modern risks move quickly, so the days of scanning or penetration testing an application for vulnerabilities once every year or so are long gone. Modern software development requires continuous application security testing across the entire software development lifecycle. Look to enhance existing development pipelines with security automation that doesn’t slow development. Whatever approach you choose, consider the annual cost to test, triage, remediate, retest, and redeploy a single application, multiplied by the size of your application portfolio. 

| Activity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Application Security Requirements | To produce a secure web application, you must define what secure means for that application. OWASP recommends you use the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), as a guide for setting the security requirements for your application(s). ASVS has been updated significantly in the past few years, with version 3.0.1 being released mid 2016. If you’re outsourcing, consider the OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex.|

| Application Security Architecture | Rather than retrofitting security into your applications and APIs, it is far more cost effective to design the security in from the start. OWASP recommends the OWASP Prevention Cheat Sheets and the OWASP Developer’s Guide as good starting points for guidance on how to design security in from the beginning. The Cheat Sheets have been updated and expanded significantly since the 2013 Top 10 was released. |

| Security Standard Controls | Building strong and usable security controls is difficult. Using a set of standard security controls radically simplifies the development of secure applications and APIs. Many popular frameworks come with standard security controls for authorization, validation, CSRF, etc.|

| Secure Development Lifecycle | To improve the process your organization follows when building applications and APIs, OWASP recommends the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM). This model helps organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing their organization. A significant update to Open SAMM was released in 2017.|

| Application Security Education | The [OWASP Education Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project) provides training materials to help educate developers on web application security. For hands-on learning about vulnerabilities, try [OWASP WebGoat](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat), [WebGoat.NET](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat.NET), [OWASP NodeJS Goat](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Node_js_Goat_Project)), or the [OWASP Broken Web Applications Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Broken_Web_Applications_Project). To stay current, come to an [OWASP AppSec Conference](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference), [OWASP Conference Training](TBA), or local [OWASP Chapter meetings](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Chapter).|

There are numerous additional OWASP resources available for your use. Please visit the [OWASP Projects](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects) page, which lists all the Flagship, Labs, and Incubator projects in the OWASP project inventory. Most OWASP resources are available on our [wiki](https://www.owasp.org/), and many OWASP documents can be ordered in [hardcopy](http://stores.lulu.com/owasp) or as [eBooks](http://stores.lulu.com/owasp).
