### Request for Comments

This is the text version of the OWASP Top 10, and although it is useful for translators and those interested in a text version, it's not the official release, which is the PowerPoint / PDF version. 

We strongly urge for any corrections or issues to be logged at GitHub:

- [https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues](https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues)

Through public transparency, we provide traceability and ensure that all voices are heard during this final month before publication.
