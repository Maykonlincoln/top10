# A9:2017 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness           | Impacts               |

| While it is easy to find already-written exploits for many known vulnerabilities, other vulnerabilities require concentrated effort to develop a custom exploit. | Prevalence of this issue is very widespread. Component-heavy development patterns can lead to development teams not even understanding which components they use in their application or API, much less keeping them up to date. Some scanners such as retire.js help in detection but determining exploitability requires additional effort. | While some known vulnerabilities lead to only minor impacts, some of the largest breaches to date have relied on exploiting known vulnerabilities in components. Depending on the assets you are protecting, perhaps this risk should be at the top of your list. |

## Is the Application Vulnerable?

You are likely vulnerable:

* If you do not know the versions of all components you use (both client-side and server-side). This includes components you directly use as well as nested dependencies.
* If any of your software is out of date. This includes the OS, Web/App Server, DBMS, applications, APIs and all components, runtime environments and libraries.
* If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to security bulletins related to the components you use.
* If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks and dependencies in a timely fashion. This commonly happens is environments when patching is a monthly or quarterly task under change control, which leaves organizations open to many days or months of unnecessary exposure to fixed vulnerabilities.  
* If you do not secure the components' configurations (see **A6:2017-Security Misconfiguration**).

## How To Prevent

Software projects should have a process in place to:

* Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.
* Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and server-side components (e.g. frameworks, libraries) and their dependencies using tools like [versions](http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/), [DependencyCheck](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check), [retire.js](https://github.com/retirejs/retire.js/), etc.
* Continuously monitor sources like [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) and [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) for vulnerabilities in your components. Use software composition analysis tools to automate the process. Subscribe to email alerts for security vulnerabilities related to components you use.
* Only obtain your components from official sources and, when possible, prefer signed packages to reduce the chance of getting a modified, malicious component.
* Monitor for libraries and components which do not create security patches for out of support or old versions, or are simply unmaintained. If patching is not possible, consider deploying a [virtual patch](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Virtual_Patching_Best_Practices#What_is_a_Virtual_Patch.3F) to monitor, detect or protect against the discovered issue.

Every organization must ensure that there is an ongoing plan for monitoring, triaging, and applying updates or configuration changes for the lifetime of the application or portfolio.

## Example Attack Scenarios

Components typically run with the same privileges as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact. Such flaws can be accidental (e.g. coding error) or intentional (e.g. backdoor in component). Some example exploitable component vulnerabilities discovered are:

* [CVE-2017-5638](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5638), a Struts 2 remote code execution vulnerability that enables execution of arbitrary code on the server, has been blamed for significant breaches.
* While [internet of things (IoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) are frequently difficult or impossible to patch, the importance of patching them can be great (eg: [St. Jude pacemakers](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/465k-patients-need-a-firmware-update-to-prevent-serious-pacemaker-hacks/)).

There are automated tools to help attackers find unpatched or misconfigured systems. For example, the [Shodan IoT search engine](https://www.shodan.io/report/89bnfUyJ) can help you find devices that still suffer from the [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) vulnerability that was patched in April 2014.
